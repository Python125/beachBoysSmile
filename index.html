  <h1>Tracks Recorded</h1>
    <h2>Do You Like Worms</h2>
      <p><b>"Do You Like Worms"</b> is song that was written for the unfinished album <em>Smile</em>. Written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, the song is about the recolonization of the American continent and contains lyrical references to the Sandwich Islands and "Bicycle Rider Back" playing cards. None of the lyrics appear to mention worms; asked about the title, Parks said he could not remember where it came from.</p>
      <p>Most of "Do You Like Worms" was recorded at one session held on October 18, 1966 at Western Studio and the group overdubbed vocals onto the track on December 21 at Columbia Studio. Further overdubs to the "Bicycle Rider" section were recorded on January 5, 1967. The latter session was logged as "Heroes and Villains: Part 2. According to historian Keith Badman, the lyrics about the "Sandwich Isles" and "ribbon of concrete" were "apparently not recorded.</p>
      <p>The Beach Boys' original recording of "Do You Like Worms" was released on the compilations Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys (1993) and The Smile Sessions (2011).</p>

        <h4>("The rain of bullets eventually brought her down")</h4>
          <p>"Heroes and Villains" is a song by The Beach Boys that was released on July 31, 1967. The song was written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks. For <em>Smile</em>, sessions for the song took place from May 11, 1966 to March 2, 1967. When <em>Smile</em> was shelved, sessions to complete "Heroes and Villains" for the <em>Smiley Smile</em> album took place from June 12 to June 14, 1967.</p>
          <p>According to <em>The Smile Sessions</em> (2011) booklet that is included in the five disc box set, Slowinski and Boyd - who researched and organized the "Smile Sessionography" - state that the first tracking session for "Heroes And Villains" took place on May 11, 1966. This session was only an experiment and not a full-blown recording. Despite documentation, Slowinski and Boyd state that the recording from this session (Master # 55999) is lost. On October 20, 1966, Brian held the first genuine instrumental session for “Heroes And Villains”, in which he recorded the verse to the song. Also during this session, he recorded "Barnyard". On October 27, 1966, an instrumental tracking session for “I'm in Great Shape" was recorded. Then on November 4, 1966, Brian demonstrated how he envisions “Heroes And Villains” to Van Dyke Parks. During this time, "I'm in Great Shape" and "Barnyard" were included in the song “Heroes And Villains”. This demonstration is included on <em>The Smile Sessions</em> as "Heroes And Villains Piano Demo". For the songs "I'm in Great Shape" and "Barnyard", the lead vocals are taken from this piano demo. Proof of this can be heard on disc 1, tracks 5 and 6, and disc 2, track 36 of the five disc box set edition</p>
          <p>In the 2004 book, <em>The Beach Boys: the definitive diary of America's greatest band: on stage and in the studio</em>, Badman states that in December 1966, Brian told Capitol Records that <em>Smile</em> would be delivered on January 15 along with the single "Heroes And Villains"/"Heroes And Villains Part II". With neither of them completed before that time, Brian continued to record more vocals from the Beach Boys for "Heroes And Villains" in January and February. Examples of vocal sessions that were recorded are, "Gee", "Cantina", "Children Were Raised", "Whistling Bridge", and "Bridge To Indians". On March 2, 1967, Brian finally finished "Heroes And Villains". However, after <em>Smile</em> was shelved in May, Badman states that the Beach Boys recorded a new vocal and re-recorded parts of the instrumental track. This included adding an organ onto the song. On June 14, "Heroes And Villains" was finally completed to Brian's satisfaction and it would be released as a single next month.</p>
