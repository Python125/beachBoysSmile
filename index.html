    <h2>Do You Like Worms</h2>
      <p><b>Do You Like Worms</b> is song that was written for the unfinished album <em>Smile</em>. Written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, the song is about the recolonization of the American continent and contains lyrical references to the Sandwich Islands and "Bicycle Rider Back" playing cards. None of the lyrics appear to mention worms; asked about the title, Parks said he could not remember where it came from. Most of "Do You Like Worms?" was recorded at one session held on October 18, 1966 at Western Studio and the group overdubbed vocals onto the track on December 21 at Columbia Studio. </p>
